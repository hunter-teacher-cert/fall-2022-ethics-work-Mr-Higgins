To all students and faculty,

It has become apparent that concerns for safety have reached a peak during these trying times. However, our stance at This Particular School is that we will not be implementing contact tracing applications at this time.

Student safety is a priority, but it is neither feasible nor reasonable to expect every student to have a third party application active at all times during their school day when we already have the ability to track student location and pathways through our building security cameras. Furthermore, due to the age of our school building, many geopositioning applications fail to properly show student location on school grounds, and thus would not work appropriately if used.

We understand if there are parents concerned with potential contact circumstances, but rest assured that random testing along with our vigilant community notifying us of COVID infections, we can do our best to protect our students.
