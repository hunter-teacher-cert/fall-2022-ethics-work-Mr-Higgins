# Google Classroom vs. Blackboard
## The Similarities
Both privacy terms are hardly similar, the biggest overlap between the two is that they acknowledge that partner programs and add-ons will require information inevitably for them to run appropriately.
## The Differences
Google Classroom does in fact heartily emphasize that any and all possible data to collect is forfeit in Classroom environments (a generous donation if that's entirely true) and leave it at that.
I'm not entirely sold on the wording of Blackboard's policies, because their emphasis with their vendors and partners is that "the data will be available under their (Blackboard's) same restrictions of usage and kept to the same standards of privacy" but realistically that's hard to enforce without auditing all vendors in some way periodically... But maybe I'm overlooking some detail.
## The Data
The data that _could_ be shared in the event of a breach:
### Google Classroom
* Email
* Name
* School
* Classes
* Grades
* File Uploads
### Blackboard
* Email
* Name
* School
* Classes
* Grades
* File Uploads
* Password Management Access*

*As far as I've experienced, I don't believe Blackboard offers institutional password management. That said both can be integrated into Microsoft Business Solution Services which can leverage this issue.
